                <h2>
                    ​Decks increase your living space.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you have a small yard, you can still enjoy the outdoors by adding a deck. <a href="https://www.ogdendecks.com/ogden-decks-gallery.html">Decks provide</a> extra space for entertaining, relaxing, and enjoying the outdoors. In fact, decks can add up to 300 square feet of additional living space to your home
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are several things to consider when planning to build a deck, such as size, shape, material, and location. You will also need to obtain a building permit from your local municipality before starting construction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Size: The first thing to consider is how much space you have to work with. If you have a large yard, you may want to build a multi-level deck or one with multiple sections. If space is limited, you can still create a beautiful and functional deck by choosing a smaller size.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shape: The shape of your deck will also be determined by the amount of space you have to work with. If you have a large, open area, you may want to consider a rectangular or square deck. If space is limited, you can still create an interesting shape by adding curves or angles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Material: The type of material you use for your deck will be determined by the look you are going for and the amount of maintenance you are willing to do. Wood decks require more upkeep than composite decks, but they offer a classic look that many homeowners prefer. Composite decks are made from recycled materials and require less maintenance, but they may not have the same aesthetic appeal as wood decks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Location: The location of your deck is also important to consider. If you live in an area with a lot of sun, you may want to choose a material that is resistant to fading or discoloration. If you live in an area with a lot of rain, you may want to choose a material that is resistant to mold and mildew.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Building permit: Before you begin construction on your deck, you will need to obtain a building permit from your local municipality. This permit will ensure that your deck meets all the necessary building codes and regulations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you have considered all of these factors, you are ready to start planning your dream deck!

                <p>
                    A multi-level deck is a great option if you want to create different areas for different activities. For example, you could have a lower level for dining and entertaining and an upper level for relaxing and enjoying the view.

                    If you live in a city, a rooftop deck is a great way to enjoy the outdoors without leaving home. You'll get plenty of fresh air and stunning views of the skyline. Just be sure to check with your local building codes before construction begins.

                    A floating deck is a great option if you have a pool or pond in your yard. This type of deck allows you to enjoy the water without getting wet. Plus, it's a great place to relax and enjoy the scenery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    6. The screened-in deck
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want to enjoy the outdoors without worrying about insects, a screened-in deck is a great option. This type of deck allows you to enjoy the fresh air while keeping bugs at bay. Plus, it's a great way to keep an eye on your kids while they're playing outside.
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    A covered deck is a great way to extend your outdoor living space. This type of deck protects you from the sun and weather, making it a comfortable place to relax or entertain guests. Plus, it can add value to your home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    8. The garden deck
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you love to garden, a garden deck is a great way to display your plants and flowers. This type of deck is a great way to show off your green thumb and add some color to your yard. Plus, it's a great place to relax and enjoy the outdoors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    9. The party deck
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you love to entertain, a party deck is a great way to host gatherings. This type of deck includes features like a built-in bar or kitchen, making it the perfect place to mix drinks or prepare food. Plus, it's a great place to socialize and have fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    10. The custom deck
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you can't find a deck that meets your needs, you can always have one custom-built. This option allows you to choose the size, shape, and features of your deck.

                            Of course, building a deck is not a cheap investment. The cost of materials and labor can easily run into thousands of dollars. But if you're handy with tools and don't mind getting your hands dirty, you can build a deck yourself and save a lot of money in the process.

                    Decks are low maintenance.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When it comes to home improvements, decks are one of the easiest things to maintain. With just a little bit of care, you can keep your deck looking like new for years to come. Plus, there are no major repairs or replacement costs associated with decks. All you need to do is clean it and seal it on a regular basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a deck, chances are you will want to know how to properly maintain it. Below are some tips on deck care:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Regularly sweep your deck to remove debris such as leaves and dirt. This will also help to prevent mold and mildew from forming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Once every few months, hose down your deck with a garden hose to remove any dirt or grime that has built up over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Apply a fresh coat of sealer or stain every one to two years (depending on the type of product you use). This will help protect your deck from the elements and keep it looking its best.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. If you have any planks that are starting to show signs of wear and tear, replace them as needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5. Inspect your deck regularly for any loose nails or screws. Tighten or replace them as necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By following these simple tips, you can keep your deck in great shape for many years to come.
